Cockfighting is alive and well on the island of Phuket. Gamecocks are a proud yet deadly flock of birds who usually engage in feats of strength during a drinking session, meant to impress themselves and their friends, before engaging in a wild flurry of blows, hacks and kicks against an unlucky opponent who may have offended their sensibilities.

It is generally wise to avoid the ruffled gamecock as they may be prone to fight objects both animate and inanimate without regard for safety, but if you must get up close to observe the match, ensure there's enough crowd around you so you can anonymously melt away and report the results of the bout to anyone you encounter.

These engagements usually end up as visual fodder for diligent social media producers, including a trip to Patong Hospital or the dreaded Police Box.
