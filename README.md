# Lotería Phuket
Built with Gatsby. The site is hosted at [https://loteria-phuket.now.sh/](https://loteria-phuket.now.sh/).

This is an experimental site I built while learning my way around [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs) and React. It's basically a set of Lotería cards depicting some of the more common elements of life in Phuket, Thailand.

Aside from learning Gatsby it was a good opportunty to explore rendering data using the CSS grid in combination with Flexbox, which is something interesting to work on. Any suggestions for additional cards are welcome.

Inspired by the work [Lynn Fisher](https://lynnandtonic.com/web/) has done.
